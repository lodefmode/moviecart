Each folder contains a PCB centered around a different package of dsPIC33CK64MC105.
They are otherwise identical.
Note that dsPIC33CK32MC105 is also a suitable drop in replacment at half the program size.

48_TQFP_7x7:
	DSPIC33CK32MC105-I/PT

48_UQFN_6x6:
	DSPIC33CK64MC105-I/M4


Todo:

2.31 
Central hole size:
Still too narrow on some production runs, as drill tolerance varies.
Try increasing slightly.

17/64" drill bit fits perfectly.
3.3734375 mm radius?

currently its:
3.190mm (was 3.175mm)

Around 0.18 mm increase each side.

2.32/2.42:
  hole size increased from 3.19 to 3.373

-----------------

SIKOR version:


Missing 'TV/LABEL SIDE'

special sdcard access version for injection molded offerings:
 -consider moving sd card further to edge to increase access on slotted cart.
   even widen entire top half left/right to reach edge.
 -deepen side tabs toward center to fit
 -consider shortening center post hole to match?
 -consider a double tab piece that glues through rectangular slots for stability.

consider:
  tactile switch to burn/factory reset firmware updates, instead of grounding programming pins

LED is way too bright


Octob 5 2024:

2.42:  change name to 2.52  (2.42 is P/T version)

  'TV SIDE'
  deeper tabs
  SD moved to left edge
  tactile switch to factory reset / restore  (grounding programming pins still works)
