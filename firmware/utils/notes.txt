#full replacement firmware, not advised

make changes to main.c
grab output listing (output1.txt) from 0000 to 4799 (strip first header line)
!cl.exe code2payload.c calculatecode.c
!./code2payload.exe output1.txt payload.s

use new payload.s in bootloader project, recompile
grab output listing (output2.txt) from 4800 to somewhere before final string of 0xFFF (strip first header line)
(might be around 20,484)

*NOTE* output2.txt should start with two NOPs for earlier 1.x 
They are sometimes not placed at the beginnning of the function.

!cl.exe code2updatefrm.c calculatecode.c
!./code2updatefrm.exe < output2.txt
to create update.frm

update.frm might be 45072 bytes
